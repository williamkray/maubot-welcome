# welcome bot

# this plugin is now deprecated, and its functionality (and improvements!) have been moved into
[communitybot](https://github.com/williamkray/maubot-communitybot)

bot that watches specific rooms, and will send a customizable message to those rooms when someone joins them.

optionally, will send a room message (with @room in it!) to a separate notification room, i.e. to alert a group of
people that a new member has joined one of the watched rooms.
